### About Me!

My name is Mincy (19), and I'm a silly transfemme creature who doesn't take (almost) anything seriously.
Coding included.

I mostly just contribute to projects by reporting bugs, giving translations and very rarely do something on my own.

I love cookies (not the web ones, chocolate cookies) and strawberry milk.
